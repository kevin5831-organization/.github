Plutio is All-In-One platform. A mobile application built with [Expo](https://expo.dev).

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. **Run the app**
   - Scan the QR code with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) (Android/iOS)
   - Press `a` for Android emulator
   - Press `i` for iOS simulator

## Development

This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction). Start developing by editing files in the **app** directory.

## Reset Project

To start with a clean slate:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This moves the starter code to **app-example** and creates a blank **app** directory.
